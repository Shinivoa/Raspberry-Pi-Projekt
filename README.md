Welcome to the Raspberry Pi Miniature Home Project repository! Here, we embark on an exciting journey of building a miniature smart home using Raspberry Pi as the core controller. This project aims to showcase how Raspberry Pi can be utilized to integrate various sensors and devices, enabling home automation and monitoring.

### Project Overview

The Raspberry Pi Miniature Home Project demonstrates the construction of a miniature smart home model equipped with sensors and actuators. By leveraging Raspberry Pi's capabilities, we create a simulated environment where users can interact with and monitor different aspects of the home.

### Features

- **Sensor Integration**: Install various sensors such as temperature, humidity, motion, and light sensors to monitor environmental conditions.
- **Actuator Control**: Utilize actuators like servo motors or relays to control devices such as lights, fans, or doors.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a web interface hosted on the Raspberry Pi for remote monitoring and control of the miniature home.
- **Data Logging**: Implement data logging functionality to record sensor readings and events within the home environment.
- **Interactive Demo**: Showcase the functionality of the miniature home through interactive demonstrations and tutorials.
